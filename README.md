# Hydraulic jump
Student computer practice task.

The task is to determine the radius of **Hydraulic jump**.

Written with **C++**. 

For visualization was used **GLE - Graphic Layout Engine**.

There are 2 programm files: task **without surface tension** (main.cpp) and task **with surface tension** (main_tension.cpp).

**Phase_curves.eps** - phase curves for task **without** surface tension.

**Phase_curves_with_jump.eps** - phase curves with jump for task **with** surface tension.

*The role of the phase tension in hydraulic jump is difficult for short explonation*
